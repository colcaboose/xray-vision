This document contains documentation for the attributes of the data FITS 
file found in the source code.


TEMP:
	Lists the temperature of the detector during each event.
PH: 
	Pulse height. Also synonymous with the term "channel". Used to record the amount charge released from the scintillator.
PH_COM: 
	A list of length 9 that records pulse heights of the pixels in a
	3 x 3 grid around an event. The list is used to correct for charge spillage around the centroid event. 
STIM:
	Indicates whether an event was caused by artificially stimulating the 
	pixel. This was usually done to the pixel at index (10, 10).

.field("RAW"):
	Raw data from the detector. 

.field("PM")
